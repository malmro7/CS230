How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories help by providing the who, what and why - who wants the feature, why they want it and what it does. User stories aren't complete without acceptance criteria and details explaining what the feature is, and this is turned into code within one sprint. Interpreting user needs best done by constant communication with either the customer or client to ensure that you have enough information to produce features which can then be delivered and revised.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Usually for my own project prior to this course I tended to do more of a waterfall approach and plan much of the project before writing any code. Then I would write short pieces of the project and test them until they worked. This worked fine for me because I was mainly doing small projects, however for larger tasks I would definetely go with an agile approach. I really liked the idea of Kanban boards and the Daily Scrum and hope to incorporate those in my future development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I would say a good team member is competent, works hard and efficiently and is open to new ideas. They would also be willing to help others and let others help them, and take direction well but also stand up for themsevles and the customer if anything unethical occurs. I'm not sure if this is too vague or not.
